\begin{abstract}
% \addchaptertocentry{\abstractname}
This thesis investigates numerical methods for the simulation of surface water flows, focusing on the large scale, to local scale and the coupling models for both scales.

The general motion of a fluid mass is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which can accurately solve the local scale phenomena. However, the same level of accuracy is not required by the large scale solution to the water-related events. In contrast to the extensive use of the Finite Element Method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, the shallow-water equations are usually solved with the Finite Volume Method. Thus, an effort have been done to solve both equations in an unified framework.

The first part of this thesis is devoted to study stabilized formulations of Finite Element Method for the different forms of the shallow water equations. The stabilized formulations are analyzed to test its ability to deal with the different possible instabilities. The first source of instability is the incompatibility of the equal interpolation of the variables. The second source of instability is the presence of shocks due to the change of regime or hydraulic jumps. Finally, Gibbs oscillations may appear on the moving shoreline and monotonic properties of the physical system are lost by the numerical approximation.

The second part of the thesis is committed to the coupling strategies of the numerical methods for the Navier-Stokes and the shallow water equations. The case of a coupling from the local scale to the large scale is analyzed. This type of coupling corresponds to the generation of water-related hazards. The proposed strategy combines a Lagrangian Navier Stokes multi-fluid solver with an Eulerian method based on the Boussinesq equations, an extension of the shallow water equations.

The proposed technique is applied to the numerical simulation of landslide-generated impulse waves. Lagrangian solver uses the Particle Finite Element Method to model the landslide runout, its impact against the water body and the consequent wave generation. The results of this fully-resolved analysis are stored at selected interfaces and then used as input for the shallow water solver to model the far-field wave propagation.
This one-way coupling scheme reduces drastically the computational cost of the analyses while maintaining high accuracy in reproducing the key phenomena of the cascading natural hazard.

Over the years developing this thesis there have been many people around me who have helped me to achieve this goal. 
I am indebted to all of them and it would be impossible to mention all of them.

I want to thank to Jaume Armenogu, who encouraged me to begin a Doctorate, and also to thank Eugenio Oñate for giving me the opportunity to work on this thesis and for his advices as supervisor. I also want to thank Ignasi de-Pouplana for being my co-supervisor.

From CIMNE, tanks to Sergio Idelsohn and Riccardo Rossi for all the clarifying and fruitful lessons that they have given to me. Thanks to Alessando and Alejandro for their collaboration during the last part of the thesis. I also want to mention my colleagues who finished their doctorate in the previous years and I have been helped by their knowledge and advice, Vicente, Pablo, Jordi, Guillermo, Rubén. Let me also mention my colleagues from CIMNE. From CIMAT, thanks to Prof. Botello, Jorge López and all the friends I met in Guanajuato.

In the same line, thanks to all my colleagues, friends and so many other people that I may
not mention explicitly. Thanks to my family for their constant support and encouragement.

Finally, I want to acknowledge the doctoral scholarship received from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and Banco Santander (53 FPI-UPC 2018) and the big support that CIMNE gave to this research.
