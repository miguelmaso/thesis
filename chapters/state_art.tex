\label{state_art}


In this chapter a bibliographic revision of the methods employed to solve free surface flows problems is presented.
The analysis of the numerical methods for the shallow water equations is more extensive than the review for the Navier-Stokes equations, since this thesis presents some advances in the numerical simulation of the shallow water equations.

\subsection{Numerical methods for the shallow water models}


\subsubsection{Overview}

The computation of the dry-wet interface of the shallow water equations is a challenging problem. Due to the hyperbolic character of the equations the water height requires positivity ($h>0$) and oscillations can trigger global failure of the system. Löhner \cite{lohner2008} made a review of possible approximation methods to solve fluid dynamics. Being $u^h = N^i\hat{u}_i$ ($i=1,2,\dots,m$) an approximation of the solution $u$, the weighted residual is defined as

\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega} W^ir(u^h)d\Omega = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
 & $N^i$ & $W^i$ \\ \hline
Finite differences (FD)         & polynomial & $\delta(x_i)$ \\ \hline
Finite volumes (FV)             & polynomial & $1 \ \text{if} \ x\in\Omega_{el}$ \\ \hline
Galerkin finite elements (FEM)  & polynomial & $N^i$ \\ \hline
Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)     & polynomial & $N^i \ \text{if} \ x\in\Omega_{el}$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Possible choices of trial and test functions $N^i$ and $W^i$}
\label{possible_trial_functions}
\end{table}

In table \ref{possible_trial_functions} there are a set of possible trial and test functions and the resulting approximation method. In the recent decades a new family of finite elements have been developed which are known as the discontinuous Galerkin (DG). We are interested on the implementation of \emph{continuous Galerkin finite elements} in KratosMultiphysics.


\subsubsection{Stabilized methods}



\subsubsection{Monotonicity preserving finite elements}

Following Löhner review, there are three classical approaches: stabilized finite elements \cite{lohner2008}, flux corrected transport (FCT) \cite{lohner2008ch9} and edge based finite elements \cite{lohner2008ch10}.

\paragraph*{Stabilized FEM} Streamline-diffusion methods like SUPG are stable but not
monotonicity preserving. However, Badia and Hierro presented a monotonicity preserving stabilized finite element for hyperbolic equations \cite{badia2014}.

\paragraph*{FCT} The way to circumvent the Godunov barrier theorem \cite{godunov1959} is to develop a nonlinear scheme. FCT uses a low order (LO) monotonic scheme with a lot of diffusion and a high order (HO) oscillatory scheme. The process of combining the two schemes is called limiting:

\begin{equation}
\phi^{n+1} = \phi^n + c_e\Delta \phi_H + (1-c_e)\Delta \phi_L
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Edge based} The edge based structure is an efficient way to assemble the system matrix which resort to a
finite volume approximation of convective terms. If it is assumed that the fluxes of the variables are constant along the edges, a discontinuity will occur at the edge midpoint. Then, one can replace the Galerkin flux by a Riemann flux and obtain a total variational diminishing scheme (TVD).
